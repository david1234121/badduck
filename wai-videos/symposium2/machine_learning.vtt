00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, uh, we have Willian Watanabe

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.600
from Universidade Tecnológica
Federal do Paraná, in Brazil.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.080
We have Yeliz Yesilada
from the Middle East

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.360
Technical University, uh, Sheng Zhou

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.440
from Zhejiang University in China.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.080
I hope I pronounced it correctly.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.640
And Fabio Paternò from CNR

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.240
IST in Italy.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.240
Okay, Thank you all for joining us. And

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.040
for some of you it’s earlier in the morning.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.640
For others of you, it's later.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.520
Well, for some of you,
I guess it's really late in the evening.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.720
So thank you all for your availability.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.200
And let's start this discussion on how

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.680
I would say

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.600
current machine learning algorithms
and current machine learning applications

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.880
can support
or can improve methodologies for

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.880
automatically assessing web accessibility.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.640
And from your previous works,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.440
you’ve touched different
aspects of how this can be done.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.280
So machine learning has been used

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.360
to support web accessibility evaluation

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.680
through different aspects
such as sampling, such as metrics,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.480
such as evaluation predictions,
such as handling dynamic pages.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.520
And so and I understand that

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.280
these are domains,
not all of these domains

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.400
you have work done on those,
but some of you have worked on

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.080
specific domains.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.640
And so I would like you to focus on
the ones that you've been

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.360
working more closely.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.760
And just for us to start,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.960
just let us know
what are the current challenges

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.760
that prevent further development
and prevent further

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.720
use of machine learning or other A.I.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.560
techniques in this specific domains?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.400
Okay.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.960
And I can start with you, Willian.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.320
First of all, thank you very much for...
for everything that is being organized,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.160
it’s great to be here.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.760
... Europe
and this to give some context

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.000
and I'm Willian I'm
a professor here in Brazil.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.280
I work in accessibility,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.040
my my focus, my research

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.440
focuses on web technologies,
the ARIA specification

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.560
more specific and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.760
just in regards to everything
that has been said in the question

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.520
by Carlos Duarte,
my focus is on evaluation prediction

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.120
according to the ARIA specification

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.680
and I believe the main...

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.920
I was invited to this...

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.000
to this panel

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.320
considering my research on identification
of valences in web application.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.200
So the problem that I address is

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.240
associated to identifying

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.960
components

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.560
In web applications. When we implement
web applications, we use semi-structured

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.680
languages such as HTML.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.680
My job is to identify what

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.600
these elements
in the HTML structure represent

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.880
in the web page, like they can represent
some

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.240
widgets, some specific type of widgets.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.840
There's some components.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.760
There are some landmarks that we need

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.520
to identify in the web page.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.720
And this is basically what I do.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.640
So what I have been doing
for the last year,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.480
I have been using machine learning
for identifying these elements.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.560
I use supervised learning and I use data

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.080
provided by the DOM structure
of the web application.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.240
So I search for elements in the web page
and classifiy them as an element,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.520
widgets or anything else.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.720
The challenges in regards to that.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.360
They are

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.240
are kind of different from the challenges

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.360
that have been addressed yesterday.
Yesterday...

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.840
Yesterday... applications of machine
learning.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.240
I think they work with video in texts
that are unstructured data.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320
So they are

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.160
more complicated, I would say.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.360
And my... the main challenge
that I that I address in my research

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.560
is associated with data acquisition
and data extraction

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.600
where I identify
what kind of features that I

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.680
I should use to identify these components
in web applications

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.920
Associated with that I think they are
and to summarize,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.480
my problems are associated
with the diversity of web applications.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.280
There are different domains and

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.760
this kind of bias

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.800
and any dataset that we use,
it's difficult.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.680
For me. For instance,
to identify,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.400
a number of websites that implement

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.000
that represents all the themes of websites

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.360
that can be used, in web applications

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.120
variability in the implementation
of HTML and JavaScript,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.640
and the use of automatic tools
for extracting this data

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.920
such as

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.720
web Driver API, the DOM
structure dynamics and mutation observers.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.680
There are a lot of specifications
that are currently being developed

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.560
that I must use, and I always must

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.680
keep my observing to

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.880
to see if I can use them
to improve my research.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.560
And lastly, there is always the problem
of manual classification in...

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.880
for generating these data sets
that I can use

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.640
That’s it, Carlos.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.000
Thank you.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.760
Thank you Willian.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.080
So Yeliz... and thank you
Willian for introducing yourself

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.000
because I forgot to ask
all of you that to do that.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.040
So your first intervention, please

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.240
do give us a brief introduction about
yourselves and the work you've been doing.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.560
And so, Yeliz, I will follow with you.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.960
Hi. Hello, everybody.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.840
Good afternoon.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.960
Afternoon for me.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.680
So good afternoon, everybody.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.000
I'm Yeliz.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.680
I'm an associate professor at Middle East
Technical University

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.840
Northern Cyprus Campus.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.360
I've been doing web accessibility
research for more than 20 years now.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.920
Time goes really fast and recently
I've been exploring machine learning

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.440
and AI specifically for web accessibility.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.440
Supporting web accessibility
from different dimensions.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.520
Regarding the

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.800
challenges, I think there are
of course many challenges.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.920
But as Willian mentioned,
I can actually say that

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.600
kind of the biggest challenge for
my work has been data collection.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.760
So I can actually

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.680
say that data, of course, is critical.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.000
As it was discussed yesterday
in the other panels,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.360
Data is very critical
for machine learning approaches

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.600
and for us collecting data,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.120
making sure that the data is representing
our user groups, different user groups,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.080
and not biasing any user groups.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.240
And also, of course, preparing

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.920
and labeling the data as certain

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.560
machine learning algorithms, of course,
supervised ones they require labeling

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.120
and labeling
has also been a challenge for us

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.320
because sometimes a certain task it's
not so straightforward to do the labeling.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.320
It's not black and white.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.440
So it's been a challenge for us,
I think in that sense.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.880
And other two challenges I can mention is

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.280
I think the second one
is the complexity of the domain.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.280
When you think about the web
accessibility, sometimes people think, Oh,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.560
it's quite straightforward,
but it's actually a very complex domain.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.680
There are many different user
groups, different user requirements,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.640
so understanding those

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.760
and making sure that you actually address

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.840
different users and different
requirements, it's quite challenging.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.080
And since we also are working,
this is the last one

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.760
that I wanted to mention,
since we are also working with web pages.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.920
They are complex, they are not
well designed or well properly coded.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.920
As we always say, browsers are tolerating,
but for developing algorithms, machine

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.960
learning algorithms,
they also have to deal

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.760
with those complexities,
which makes the task quite complex.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.200
I think.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.640
So just to wrap up, I think in my work

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.840
there are three major challenges

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.720
data or the lack and quality of data.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.560
Complexity of the domain,
different users, different user

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.040
requirements and the complexity
of the resources we are using.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.640
So web pages,
the source code and the complexity of

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.120
pages that are not

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.040
conforming to standards,
I think they are really posing

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.400
a lot of challenges
to algorithms that we are developing.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.600
So these are all I wanted to say.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.400
Okay, Thank you, Yeliz.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.600
Very good

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.840
summary of major challenges

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.160
facing
everyone that works in this in this field.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.560
So thank you for that.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.080
Sheng...

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.080
I want to go with you next. Okay.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.760
Thank you, Carlos.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.320
Hello everyone.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.000
I'm Shen Zhou from Zhejiang University China

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.400
From my opinion view

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.680
I have three I think three challenges
of course currently. Now.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.920
First,
I totally agree with the idea that it is

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.920
hard to acquire labels
for more training.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.680
Since the success of machine

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.680
learning heavily
relies on a large number of labeled data,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.800
however, accessing this data labels usually
costs lots of time,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.240
which may be hard to realize,
especially in the accessibility domain.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.160
I want to take the...

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.160
take the W4A...

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.760
Sorry,
I'm a little bit nervous here, sorry...

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.080
I want to take the WCAG rule that's

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.760
we will want to take an image with text
as an example.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.520
As we discussed in the panel yesterday,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.080
most of the current image captioning or
OCR methods are trained on existing assets

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.680
rather than the image like logo
that is essential in text alternative

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.840
The label for web accessibility evaluation

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.400
should fully consider
the experience of different population.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.360
There are very few datasets
that are specifically designed

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.480
for the accessibility evaluation
task and satisfies above requirements.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.240
So the machine learning model is that
traditional datasets cannot be

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.160
well generalized
to accessibility evaluation.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.200
Second,
I think is about the web page sampling,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.560
since I have done
a little bit of work on this, I think

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.040
currently there are multiple factors
that's affecting the sampling strategy.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.960
First, sampling

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.880
has been a fundamental technique in
web accessibility evaluation

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.440
when dealing with millions of pages.
The previous page sampling

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.520
methods are usually based
on the features of each page.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.040
Such as the elements of the DOM tree
structure.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.520
The pages with similar features
assumed to be generated by the same

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.200
development framework
and have similar accessibility problems.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.600
However, with the fast growth
of web development framework

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.960
pages are developed with diverse tools.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.320
For example, pages that looks very

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.480
similar may be developed by totally
different framework and some pages

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.040
that look totally different
may be developed by the same framework.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.160
This poses great challenges for feature
based Web Accessibility evaluation.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.720
It is necessary
to incorporate more factors

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.760
into the sampling process,
such as the connection topology

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.720
among pages
and a visual similarity and typesetting.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.640
So how to identify the similarity
between pages considering

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.400
multiple factors into a unified
sampling probability

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.400
is critical for sampling.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.800
I think this could be a problem
that's related to the graph topology

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.000
content understanding

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.080
and metrical learning,
which is a comprehensive research program.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.200
So the third

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.400
challenge
I think is the subjective evaluation rules.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.200
When we evaluate the web accessibility,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.920
there are both subjective
and objective rules, right?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.920
So for example,
when evaluating the WCAG success

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.120
criterion, 1.4.5 images of text.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.360
The image is expected to be 
associated with accurate

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.200
description of text which has been
discussed in the panel yesterday.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.320
It is still challenging to verify
the matching

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:47.520
between the...

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:47.920
Yeah.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.120
I guess, uh,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.800
there are some connection issues.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.800
Let's see. Okay.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.960
He has dropped so.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.560
So uh,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.280
we’ll let Sheng... ok, he is coming back so

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.240
you're muted.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.080
Oh, okay. All right. Okay. All right.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.680
So can you.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.640
Can you continue?

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.120
Okay. I'm so sorry.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.320
Uh, okay. Okay.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.120
I think there are three challenges.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.280
And the first challenge is

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.040
same as Yeliz just described it.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.800
That's we. It is harder to

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.400
we. You

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.440
dropped when you were starting to talk
about the third challenge.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:46.760
Okay.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.720
Okay, So we still got the first and second
challenge.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.880
We, we heard that loud and clear.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.120
So now you can resume on the third
challenge.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.240
Okay? Okay. Okay.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:02.520
So the first challenge is, I think
is the subjective evaluation rules.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.480
This when evaluating
the web accessibility

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.760
there are both subjective
and objective rules.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.880
For example,
when evaluating the WCAG success criteria,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.280
1.4.5 Images of text.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.960
The image is expected to be 
associated with accurate

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.280
description text
as discussed in the panel yesterday.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.600
It is still challenging to verify
whether the matching between image

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.320
with text, since we do not have access
to the ground thruth of the

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.680
text of the image. So at

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.320
okay apparently

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.920
we lost.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.360
Sheng again.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.520
So let's just give him 10 seconds
and see if he reconnects.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.920
Otherwise we will move on to Fabio.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.880
okay, so perhaps it's

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.800
better to to move on to Fabio and and

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.440
get the perspective of someone

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.240
who is making an automated accessibility
evaluation tool available.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.120
So it's certainly going to be interesting,
so Fabio.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.200
Can you can take it from here?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.800
So, I’m Fabio, I’m a

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.600
Research director
at the Italian National Research Council,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.280
where I lead the laboratory on human interfaces
and information systems, and we have

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.800
now a project funded
by the National recovery and resilience

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.160
plan,
which is about monitoring the

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.040
accessibility
of the public administration websites.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.000
And so, I mean, in this project 
we have our tool MAUVE++,

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.920
which is a tool open, 
freely available

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.680
and it has already more than 3000
registered users

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.080
and we recently performed
an accessibility evaluation of

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.280
10,000 websites considering
200 pages for each website.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.000
So it’s really large scale...

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.120
So we were very interested
in understanding how machine learning

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.560
can help us

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.520
in these, you know, large scale
monitoring work. So I mean, for this purpose...

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.000
I’m more research...
so before this panel

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.240
I did a small, you know, 
systematic literature

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:43.840
review

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.440
So I went to the ACM digital library,
I entered machine learning and accessibility evaluation

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.960
just curious to see
what has been done so far.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.920
So I got only 43 results
which are not too many, I mean

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.160
I would have expected more. 
Then I looked through all these papers and actually

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.280
in the end, only 18 actually applied,
because other papers were more

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.360
about, ok, machine learning can
be interesting in future work, and so on.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.680
I mean, so they say that the 
specific research efforts

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.680
have been so far limited

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.160
in this area, and another characteristic
was that they were rather varied

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.240
in terms of the topic that they address.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.920
So there are people who try to predict the website 
accessibility based on the accessibility of some pages

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.920
others try to check the meaningfulness 
of alternative descriptions

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.880
others classify user interface
content elements.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.800
So I would say that
one challenge at this point is

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.680
well, machine

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.120
learning can give some, you know,
useful complementary

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.080
support to the automatic tools

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.200
that we already have

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.600
as there are many... in theory
there are more opportunities.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.920
But then in practice
there are a lot of problems.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.600
Another challenge... identifying the relevant
datasets and what are the features

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.120
that are really able to characterize the

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.720
type of aspects that we want to investigate.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.720
And I would say the third and

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.200
last main general challenge
is that we really

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.240
work with these computers who change.
In the web

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.320
this means that how people 
implement, how people use

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.720
the application is 
continuously changing.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720
So there is also

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.240
the risk that
the dataset becomes soon

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.480
obsolete, not sufficiently updated

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.720
for addressing all the emerging
needs that can occur.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.560
Okay.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.560
Thank you for that perspective and Sheng

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.120
I want to give you now the opportunity

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.760
to finish up your intervention.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.320
Okay.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.880
Thank thank you, Carlos, and sorry
for the lagging here

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.000
so and so I will continue my

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.640
third opening of the challenge.
From my opinion

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.520
the third challenge is the 
subjective evaluation rules.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.720
This one, evaluating web accessibility

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.200
there are both subjective
and objective rules and one,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.760
for example,
when evaluating the image to text rule,

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.960
the image is expected to be associated
with accurate description texts

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.320
and and
and as discussed in the panel yesterday,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.320
it is still challenging
to verify the matching between the image

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.600
and the the text
since there are no ground truth.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.640
What kind of text
should describe this image?

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.560
So as a result, the accessibility
evaluation system is harder to justify

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.840
whether the alternate text
really matches the image.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.040
So, thanks.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.000
Okay. Thank you.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.760
And I'll take it from what I guess
most of you.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.120
Well, all of you have in one way
or another mentioned one aspect of

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.080
web accessibility evaluation,

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.600
which is conformance to

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.680
the requirements to guidelines.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.280
You, several of you mentioned the web
content accessibility guidelines

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.400
in one way or another, and

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.040
checking what we do currently.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.400
So far it's and following up on
what Sheng

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.760
was just mentioning, are objective rules.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.360
So that's what we can do so far, right?

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.480
Then when we start thinking about
and because the guidelines are themselves

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.080
also subject to subjectivity
and fortunately

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.040
at the

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.320
how can we try

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.440
to automate the access, the evaluation

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.960
of those more subjective guidelines
or more subjective rules?

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.840
And how do you all think
that artificial intelligence

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.920
algorithms or machine learning
based approaches

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.560
can help us to assess conformance

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.280
to those technical requirements
to to accessibility guidelines?

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.360
And I'll start with you now, Yeliz.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.560
And thank you.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.520
Carlos.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.440
So regarding the conformance testing,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.840
so maybe we can actually think of this
as two kinds of problems.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.080
The one is the testing, the other one
is confirming basically repairing

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.800
or automatically fixing the problems.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.200
So I see actually that

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.480
machine learning and AI in general

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.080
I think can help in both sides,
in both parties.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.840
So regarding the testing and auditing,
if we take, for example,

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.200
So regarding the testing and auditing,
if we take, for example,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.200
WCAG evaluation methodology
as the most systematic methodology

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.400
to evaluate for accessibility,

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.000
it includes, for example, five stages,
five steps.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.880
So I think

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.400
machine learning
can actually help us in certain steps.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.560
For example, it can help us to choose

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.080
a representative sample,
which is the third step in WCAG-EM.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.400
We are currently doing some work on that
for example, to explore how to use

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.040
unsupervised learning algorithms
to decide, for example,

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.760
what is a representative sample
because Fabio, for example, mentioned

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.040
the problem of evaluating a large scale

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.000
websites with millions of pages.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.200
So how do you decide for example,
which ones to represent?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.160
I mean, which ones to evaluate?

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.400
And do they really for example,

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.440
if you evaluate some of them,

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.480
how much of the sites
you actually cover, for example.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.800
So there I think machine learning
and AI can help.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.520
As I said,
we are currently doing some work on that,

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.160
trying to explore machine
learning algorithms for choosing

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.120
representative sample,
making sure that the pages that you are

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:33.400
evaluating really represents
the site and reduces the workload.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.160
Because evaluating millions of pages, it's
not an easy task.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.600
So maybe we can pick certain sample pages
and once we evaluate them,

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.960
we can transfer the knowledge
from those pages

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.440
to the other ones
because more or less pages

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.720
these days are developed with templates
or automatically developed.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.560
So maybe we can transfer the errors
we identified

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.640
or the ways we are fixing to the others
which are representative.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.240
Regarding the step four in WCAG-EM...

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.680
That's actually
about auditing the selected sample.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.360
So how do you evaluate
and test the sample?

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.480
I think in that part

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.240
as we all know, I mean Sheng mentioned
there are a lot of ...

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.040
subjective rules
which they require human testing.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.880
So maybe there we need to explore more

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.360
how people,
I mean how humans evaluate the certain

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.040
requirements

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.840
and how
we can actually automate those processes.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.440
So can we have machine learning algorithms
that learn from how people

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.120
evaluate them, assess and implement those.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.160
But of course, as we mentioned
in the first part, data is critical

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.640
valid data and quality of data
is very critical for those parts

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.840
regarding the repairing
or automatically fixing certain problems.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.360
I still I also think that machine learning
algorithms can help.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.720
For example, regarding

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.400
the images Sheng mentioned,
we can automatically test

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.560
whether there is an alt text or not,
but not the quality of the alt text.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:23.120
So maybe there may be
we can explore more and

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.120
do more about

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.440
understanding
whether it's a good alt text or not

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.240
and try to fix it
automatically by learning the

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.440
from the context
and other aspects of the site.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.920
Or I've been doing, for example,
research in complex structures

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.320
like tables, they are also very difficult
and challenging

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.200
for accessibility, for testing
and for repairing.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.280
We've been doing, for example,
research in understanding

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.080
whether we can differentiate

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.120
and learn to differentiate
a layout table from a data table.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.560
And if it is a complex table,
can we actually, for example, learn

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.560
how people are reading that
and guiding the repairing of those?

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.840
We can, I guess, also do
similar things with the forms

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.200
we can learn
how people are interacting with forms

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.440
and try to some complex structures
like forms or rich and dynamic content.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.200
As Willian is working on.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:29.760
So maybe we can actually do, for example,
more work in there to automatically fix,

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.840
which can be encoded in, let's say,
authoring tools or authoring environments

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.920
that they include AI
without the developers

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.400
noticing that they are actually
using AI to fix the problems.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.320
So just to wrap up,
I know I have a limited time

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:50.240
just to wrap up, so I see that
ML can contribute in two things.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.600
Both testing and
repairing I think can help.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.040
I agree and

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.440
some of the you things you mentioned
are really

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.560
I guess they can be first steps.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.360
We can assist a human expert,

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.320
the human evaluator,
and take away some of the load.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.320
And that's also what I, I take from
from your intervention.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.000
So, Fabio,
I would like your your take on this.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.360
I mean, actually

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.960
I think I agree with what Yeliz said before.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.960
So first of all,
we have to be aware of the complexity

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.360
of accessibility evaluation
because we could just think about

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.320
WCAG 2.1,
which is composed of 78 success

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.640
criteria, which are associated

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.000
with some hundreds of techniques,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.920
of specific evaluation techniques.
This is the kind of statement that it seems like

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.040
it is going to increase the number
of techniques... and so on...

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:01.440
So the automatic support
is really fundamental. And let’s say...

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.160
In general, when you use automatic
support, the result over the check

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.320
would be okay, these are a pass...
No, it fails

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.200
And the other one is
cannot tell

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.800
So one possibility.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.360
I think that can be interesting...
how to exploit machine learning

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.280
in the situation which...
you know... the automatic

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.240
solution is not able to 
deterministically provide

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.800
okay or fail. I mean, so these could be 
an interesting opportunity

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.320
which was also explored in the
WADCHER European project.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.200
So, in this case the idea was to allow

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.360
an accessibility validator

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.480
human accessibility expert

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.920
in this case to provide the input
and then to try to use this input

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.240
in order to train 
the intelligent system

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.760
then it was not possible to extend it to

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.120
to validate these solutions. But,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.320
for sure, for example, if I think about... 
it’s really easy automatically to detect

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.040
weather or not the 
alternative description exist.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.680
It must much more difficult
to say whether it is meaningful.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.840
So, in this case, for example,

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.320
I have seen... also before it’s been 
mentioned... a lot of improvements in

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.000
AI applied to recognizing

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.920
in images what the content is.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.120
So I have also seen that there's
some attempt in this direction

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.360
has been performed,
so we can think of situation in which

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.480
the AI take
the image provides the descriptors

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.960
and then there is a kind of a similarity 
check, between these automatically

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.840
generated descriptions, the one
that has been provided by the developer,

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:47.480
and see whether to some extent
is meaningful. These, I think, is something

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:54.000
which is possible. What I’m not sure is
how much we can find a general solution

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.840
so, a solution that can always work.
I mean, so, I can see that this kind of AI

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.960
probably will be
associated with some level of

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.080
confidence and then, I think, 
at this point we can also think of

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:06.560
leaving to the

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.120
end user decide what should be 
the level of confidence

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.240
that is acceptable
when, you know, this automatic

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.200
support is used to 
understand the way that

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.920
the description, the alternative 
description, is meaningful.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.320
So that would be the direction
where I would 

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.240
try, I mean, from the perspective
of people who work on tools

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.120
for automatic validation
and try to, you know, introduce

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.760
AI inside such

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.960
automatic frameworks. 
But another

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.400
key point that we have to be careful
is the transparency.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.960
I mean, when we talk about AI
we often say

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.160
about the problem
of the black box.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.680
There is a lot of discussion
about explainable AI. In explainable

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.520
AI, usually people try to say “oh the AI is 
not able to explain why this element

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.920
generated this result” or how can a change
in this element, you know, obtained a different result.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.480
What happens if a change

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.000
is handled this way.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.520
So these, let’s say, 
questions in XAI

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.760
are also the questions 
that people encounter

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.920
when they have to interact with
an evaluation tool.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.760
And also, there is simply a study
about the transparency of the tool.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.960
So what about these tools
that we have now available.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:21.880
It was published

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.920
in ACM Transactions on 
Accessible Computing.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.920
And it turned out that

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:32.520
even without AI, often 
these tools are a little bit black boxes.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.720
They’re not sufficiently
transparent, so,

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.360
for example, they say,
we support this success criterion

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.600
but did not say which technique they
actually apply for the purpose.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.160
How these techniques
are implemented.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.880
So, let’s say, that often users 
are disoriented because

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.000
they use different tools
they get different results

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.800
they do not understand
the reason of such differences.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.240
So let's say that this
point of transparency is already

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:06.920
fundamental now that usually such
validation tools do not use AI

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.880
we have to be careful that

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.720
if we add AI, should be added 
in such a way that is explainable

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.360
so that we can help people to better
understand what happens in the evaluation

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.720
and not, you know, just giving results
that we take as a

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.040
right without any sufficient explanation.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.680
Yeah,
I think that's a very important point

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.360
because if I'm a developer
and I'm trying to solve

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.680
accessibility issues, I need to understand
why is there an error...

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.080
not just that
there is an error, over there.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.960
So yeah, that's, that's a very important,
very important point.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.240
Thank you, Fabio.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.680
So, Sheng, next to you.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.920
Okay. Thanks.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.520
And considering the incorporating

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.040
the artificial intelligence,
I will try to find some way in

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.920
help the developers

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.480
so the first one is the code
generation for automatically

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.040
fixing the accessibility problems.
As Yilez just

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.080
said... web accessibility
evaluation has been studied, but

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.680
we have to stand

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.640
at the view of the developers.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.480
If the evaluation system
only identify or locate

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.720
locate the accessibility problem,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.680
it may be still hard for developers
to fix these problems.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.720
Things, some developers may lack
experience on this,

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.520
and recently the artificial
intelligence based code

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.760
generation has been well 
developed and given some

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.880
historical code on fixing 
accessibility problems

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.560
we have tried to train
artificial intelligence model

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.080
to automatically detect
the problem linked to a code snip

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:57.680
and to provide suggestions
for the developers.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.520
We expect that this function
could help the developers fix

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.600
the accessibility problem and improve

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.240
their websites more efficiently.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.280
And the second way is for the developers

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.520
is about the content generation.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.560
As as discussed in the panel yesterday,
there has been a

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.960
there have been several attempts
in generating text alternates

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.400
for images or videos with the help 
of the computation of NLP

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.160
techniques.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.120
However,

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.160
it may be not very practical
for the image generators

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.960
to provide the text alternates since the 
state of the art methods usually requires

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.400
large models that are deployed on

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.640
GPU servers which is not...

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.840
which is not convenient
for frequently updated images.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.200
So recently we have been working

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.520
on some knowledge
distillation methods, which aims at a

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.680
distill lightweight model
from a large model

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.120
and we want to develop a lightweight
artificial intelligence models

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:12.680
that can be deployed in the... browser
extension or some lightweight

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.080
software.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.800
We hope to reduce the time cost
and the computation

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.200
cost of image providers
and encourage them to conform

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.440
the accessibility technical requirements.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.560
Okay. Thank you.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.080
Thank you.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.120
That's another very relevant points.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.080
Make sure that whatever new techniques
we develop

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.560
are really accessible
to those who need to to use them.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.040
And so the
the computational resources are also

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.480
a very
important aspect to take into account.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.440
And so, Willian next your take on this,

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.000
please.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.240
Okay. Okay.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:58.960
Well, first, I would like to take
from what Yeliz said that we

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.960
we have basically I it's nice to see
that everyone is agreeing with everything

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.280
that has been said... is like we
we talked before but we didn’t

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.200
we didn't talk at all

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.440
and so it's nice to see that
everyone is having the same problems and

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.560
about what Yeliz said that she divided

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.720
the work of 
automatic evaluation in three steps.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.560
The first one is testing
and the second one is

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.240
automatically repairing
accessibility on websites.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.400
From my end and specifically,

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.800
I don't work with something that is,

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.880
I will say

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.840
subjective like image content generation.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.760
I... my work mostly 
focused on identifying widgets.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.920
And this is kind of objective, right?

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.840
It's a dropdown.
It's not a toolkit.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.840
This is something that I don't need
to worry

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.280
about being sued over a bad 
classification or something else.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.960
So... this is a different

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.320
aspect of accessibility that I work on
and specifically my end

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.000
I work with supervised
learning as everyone and...

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.120
classifying DOM elements as specific

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.480
components, interface components.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.320
I, I use features extracted 
from the DOM structure. So

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.360
I think everyone

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.720
mentioned this, Sheng mentioned it as well.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.840
Yeliz mentioned it in the question
about tables and everything else and

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.120
I'm trying to use data

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.040
from websites
that I evaluate as accessible

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.960
to enhance the accessibility of websites

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.360
that I don't... that don't 
implement these requirements.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.240
For instance,

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.680
I see a website that implements rules,
that implements the ARIA specification.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.800
So I use it.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.520
I extract data from it to to
maybe apply it in a website

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:04.080
that doesn’t. This is kind of the,
the work that I'm working,

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.920
this is kind of what I'm doing right now.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.360
And... there is another thing.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.440
So...

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.840
Fabio also mentioned the question
about confidence.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.120
I think this is kind of critical for us
in terms of machine learning.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.280
I think the word that we use
usually is accuracy

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.920
and I believe that what will guide

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.480
each of us as researchers,
whether we work on tests

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.600
or automatic repair, is basically 
the accuracy of our methodologies.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.400
If I have

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.400
a lower

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:47.680
accuracy problem, 
I will use a testing approach.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.080
Otherwise, I will try to 
automatically repair the webpage.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.560
Of course, the best result we can get
is automatic repair.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.760
This is what will scale
better for our users.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.400
This is what will benefit more users

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.960
in terms of scale.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.800
I think that it, Carlos. Everyone talked
about everything that I wanted to say,

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.160
so this is mostly
what I would say different.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.360
So this is nice. Okay.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.160
Still, let me just

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.000
a small provocation.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.160
You said that you were

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.400
everything that you work in 
widget identification is objective.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.720
I will disagree a little bit
and I'm sure we can find several

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.120
examples of pages where you don't know
if that's a link or a button.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.120
It's so there can be subjectivity in there
also.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.800
So yeah, but just that,
just a small provocation, as I say.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.640
So we are fast approaching.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:51.520
Yeah.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.520
When

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.720
the conversation is good, time flies by
so we are fast approaching the end.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.680
So I will ask you to just quickly

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.200
comment on a final aspect,
just one minute or two.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.440
So please try to, to stick to that
so that we don't go over time

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.520
and just you've already been in some ways

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.240
approaching this,
but just what do you expect?

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.640
What would be
one of the major contributions?

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.720
What are your future perspectives
about the use of machine

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.720
learning techniques
for web accessibility evaluation?

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.960
And I will start with you now, Fabio.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.640
Okay, I mean, if I think

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:40.160
about a couple of interesting,
you know, possibilities,

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.760
open up by 
machine learning, I mean,

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.960
you know.... when we....
when we have a user interface...

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.080
generally speaking we
have two possible approaches.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:55.480
So one is to look at the code,
the associated generic interface

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.520
and see whether it is compliant
with some rules. In other approaches

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.600
to look at how people interact
with the system.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.120
So to look at the logs of 
user interaction.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:12.080
And so, in the past we did some work 
where we created a tool to identify

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.520
bad usability smells,
which means

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.880
patterns of interaction that highlight
there is some usability problems.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.720
So for example, we look at mobile devices
when there are a lot of pinch out, pinch in,

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.360
that means that probably the 
information is not well presented or

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.320
when people access continuously different 
links it means the links are too close, I mean...

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.120
so it's possible to identify
sequences of interaction that highlight

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.000
there is a usability problem.
So, one possibility, you know...

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.320
is to use some kind of machine 
learning for classifying

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.400
interaction with some
assistive technology

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.360
that highlighted this kind of problems...
that allow us from the data

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.360
to use experience that
there are some specific

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.920
accessibility problems.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.560
And... the second one... is about...

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:06.000
we mentioned before the importance
of providing explanation

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.240
about a problem or why 
it is a problem and how to solve it.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.960
So I think that would be 
the idea

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:18.440
in theory.... an idea application
for a conversational agent.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.880
Now there is a lot if discussion,
for example, around ChatGPT

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.240
but

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.480
it’s very difficult, you know,
to actually design

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.480
this case... a conversational agent that
is able to take into account

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:38.080
the relevant context, which in 
this case is the type of user

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.480
that is actually now asking for help,
because there are really many types of users

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.480
when people look at accessibility results,
you know, that can be the web

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.600
commission with the person who has decided
to have a service but don’t know anything

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.640
about its implementation,
and it can be 

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.760
the user, the disabled user,
the developer, the accessibility expert.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:02.680
Each of them require a different
language, different terms, different

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.720
type of explanation,
because when they look at... is this

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.640
website accessible,
they really have different criteria

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.480
to understand
the level of accessibility

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.440
and how to, then, operate 
in order to improve it.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.160
So, this is one dimension 
of the complexity.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.360
The other dimension of the complexity
is the actual implementation.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:30.440
It's really... we have... in this experience we
are conducting in our laboratory

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.160
with these large scale validation.... 
ten thousand websites... it was really amazing

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:41.040
to see how different, you know, implementation
languages... technical context...

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.440
people have used in order to

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.560
implement the website.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.920
I mean, even people who 
have used the same

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.440
JavaScript frameworks, they can use them
in very different ways

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.240
and so on.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.960
So when you want to 
provide an explanation

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.120
often it’s disappointing just providing an understanding

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.480
a description of the errors... 
some standard examples

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.520
of how to solve the problem because often

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.160
there are different situations
that require some specific

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.920
additional consideration for
better explaining

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.480
how that error occurred,
and what can be done in order to solve it.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.200
But this part... this complexity... a good
conversational agent for accessibility

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.080
would be a great result.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.320
Thank you.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.280
Sheng, you want to go next?

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.880
Okay so so time is limited.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.440
I will save time.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.480
I will talk about the future

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.240
perspective about the 
efficient page sampling.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:48.360
According our data analyzed,
we find that the page... the web pages

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.080
that with similar connection
structure with other pages,

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.200
it usually have
some similar accessibility problem.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.000
So we tried to take this into...

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:04.000
take this into account
for the accessibility evaluation.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.480
And recently we used the graph
neural networks,

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.040
which has been a hot research
topic in machine learning community.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.360
It combines both the network topology
and the node, the attributes

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.480
and the unified representation
for each node.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:27.480
And here each node

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.640
Okay, I guess we lost Sheng again.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.320
So in the interest of time
I will skip immediately to you,

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:39.560
Willian.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.240
Okay. See,

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:42.680
my take on this

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.840
I think it will be... pretty direct.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:49.360
I, I think Fabio will talk about it,
but we are all working

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.640
with specific guidelines
inside of a set of guidelines

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.040
of accessibility guidelines,
of WCAG.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.200
And I think the the

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.760
the next step that we should address
is associated with generalization

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:09.160
and incorporating into project
ready projects into the project

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.960
that's just incorporated in
any automatic evaluation tool.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:18.640
And so in regards to all the problems

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.000
that we mentioned, associated to data
acquisition, manual classification,

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.880
we had to find a way
to scale our experiments

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.600
so that we can guarantee
that it will work in any

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.360
theme or website.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.280
I in regards to my research specifically,
I think there are some I'm

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.080
trying to work in an automated generation
of the structure for websites.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.760
For instance, generating
header structures and other

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.360
specific structures that the user can use

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.720
to practically... automatically enhance

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.920
the web accessibility of web pages

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.280
And I think I think that's it.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.480
In regards to what you said, Carlos,
just so that I can clear myself,

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.920
I... what I wanted to say
is that... different from the panelists

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.920
from yesterday and different from Chaoai,

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.000
for instance, I think I'm working with

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.280
a simpler

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.080
machine learning approach.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.920
I don't use deep learning, for instance,
and since I don't see the

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.600
the use for it yet in my research

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.680
because my research

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.640
I think Yeliz mentioned that she
she might use for labeling

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:38.120
and other stuff... like generation
and I haven't reached that point yet.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:43.120
I think there are some a lot of things
that we can do with just with classification,

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.160
for instance.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.080
That's it. 
Okay. Thank you.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.440
And Yeliz, you want to conclude?

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.080
Yes, I actually

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:58.000
at least I hope that we will see
developments again in two things.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.840
I think the first one
is automated testing.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:07.760
I think we’re now at this stage
that we have many tools and we know how

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.840
to implement and automate certain,
for example, certain guidelines.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.840
But there are a lot of bunch of others
that they are very objective.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.520
They require human evaluation.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.920
It's very costly and expensive.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.400
I think, from evaluation perspective.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:31.080
So I'm hoping that there will be
developments in machine learning

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:36.880
and AI algorithms to support
and have more automation in those ones

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.840
that are really now requires the human

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.960
to do the evaluations.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.720
And the other one is about the repairing.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.960
So I'm also hoping
that we will also see developments

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:56.160
in automating the kind
of fixing the problems, automatically,

00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:01.480
learning from the good examples
and being able to develop solutions

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.640
while the pages are developed,
they are actually automatically fixed

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.680
and sometimes may be seamless
to the developers

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:15.280
so that they are not worried about the,
you know, certain issues.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:20.840
Of course, Explainability
is very important to explain developers

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.280
what's going on,
but I think automating certain things

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.480
there would really help
automating the repairment.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.440
Of course, to do that,
I think we need datasets

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.640
and maybe hopefully in the community
we will have shared datasets

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.800
that we can all work with
and explore different algorithms.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.480
As we know it's costly.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.600
So exploring and doing research

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:47.200
with existing data, it helps a lot.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:52.600
So I'm hoping that in the community
we will see public datasets and of course

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.440
the technical skills are very important.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:01.440
So human centered A.I.,
which is needed here I think is important.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.640
So hopefully we will also see more people

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.520
contributing to that
and the the development.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.960
And of course, we should always remember,
as Jutta

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:14.040
was mentioning yesterday,
the bias is critical.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.280
So when we are talking about, for example,
automatically testing certain,

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:22.760
automating the test of certain rules,
we should make sure that we are

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:27.360
not biasing certain user groups
and we are really targeting everybody

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.240
and different user
groups, different needs and users.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.120
So that's all I wanted to say.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:38.160
Thank you so much, Yeliz.
And for bringing also that note to too.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.240
I think it was a great way to finish this.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.680
This panel.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.040
So thank you so much 
to the four of you.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.520
Really interesting to see
all of those perspectives and what you

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.120
what you're working on
and what you're planning

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.440
on doing so in the next

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:58.560
years.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.640
I guess

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.320
let me just draw your attention.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:05.680
There are several
interesting questions on the Q&amp;A.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:10.360
So if you do have a chance,
try to answer them there.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:15.200
We unfortunately didn't have time to
to get to those during our panel.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.520
But I think there are and there are some
that really have your names on it.

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.400
So you're exactly the

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.200
the correct person to answer those.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:31.320
So once again, thank you so much for
for your participation was great

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:35.480
and I will now have a shorter break

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:40.120
than the 10 minutes and has
and will be back in 5 minutes.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:44.040
So 5 minutes past the hour.
