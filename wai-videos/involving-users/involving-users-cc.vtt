00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.640
Involving users in web accessibility.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.240
Accessibility is about making your websites
and applications usable by people with disabilities.

3
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.640
That includes your customers, clients, employees,
students, and others.

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.140
Unfortunately many approach accessibility
just as a checklist.

5
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.420
This risks missing the real purpose of accessibility
- the user experience.

6
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.600
Involving people with disabilities throughout
your design and development process

7
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.200
can be more effective and yield better results:

8
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.140
designers and developers learn how people with disabilities use the web,

9
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.830
and understand assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use;

10
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:55.010
the project team is more motivated when
they understand how their work impacts people's lives;

11
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.940
development is more efficient, and your
products work better for more people,

12
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.829
with and without disability;

13
00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.753
and your resulting products are more inclusive
and reach a bigger audience,

14
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.520
have higher customer satisfaction, and demonstrate social responsibility.

15
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.695
"Involving Users in Web Projects for Better,
Easier Accessibility"

16
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.240
provides guidance on project planning,

17
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.860
and throughout the design and development process.

18
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.040
"Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility"

19
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.570
provides more specific guidance on the evaluation stage of the process.

20
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.330
Together these resources help you focus on
accessibility for your website users rather

21
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.530
than focusing on technical requirements only.

22
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.860
Web accessibility: essential for some, useful for all.

23
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:57.240
