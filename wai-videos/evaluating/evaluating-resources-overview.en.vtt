Evaluating web accessibility: resources overview.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.500
Evaluation helps you ensure that your websites

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.840
and applications meet accessibility requirements.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.000
Ideally you evaluate regularly throughout
the design and development process.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.240
This way you find errors early
and avoid costly repairs later in the process.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.300
The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, W-A-I, or WAI,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.560
provides free resources
to help you with your evaluation.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.640
"Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility"
explains how you can do some checks yourself.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.900
Even if you are new to web accessibility
and not technical,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.300
these checks give you a rough idea
of the accessibility of any web page.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.280
WAI maintains a "Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tools List" that you can filter.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.900
"Selecting Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools"
explains what tools can and cannot do.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.380
For more experienced evaluators,
WAI provides "WCAG-EM",

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.880
the "Website Accessibility Conformance
Evaluation Methodology".

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.280
The "WCAG-EM Report Tool"

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.420
helps you record the findings
as you follow the methodology.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.620
To help you better understand

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.040
how different users
experience your website and applications,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.360
WAI provides guidance in "Involving Users
in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility"

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.440
and "Involving Users
in Evaluating Web Accessibility".

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.900
With all these resources, you can learn
how to check your website for accessibility

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.180
and prioritize the issues
you need to address first.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.780
Web accessibility:
essential for some, useful for all.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:03.820
