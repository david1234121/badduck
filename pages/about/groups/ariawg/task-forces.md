The [ARIA Authoring Practices task force](/about/groups/task-forces/practices/) to develop WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, which describes considerations that might not be evident to most authors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone and recommends approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties.
